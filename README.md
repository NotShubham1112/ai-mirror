## 🎯 Project Overview

### Purpose
Create an AI companion for an **Emotion Recognition AI Mirror** that:
- ✅ Recognizes facial expressions and emotional context
- ✅ Understands age-appropriate conversation
- ✅ Responds with safe, friendly, educational answers
- ✅ Operates **100% offline** on Raspberry Pi
- ✅ Includes comprehensive safety filters
- ✅ Respects privacy with local-only data storage

### Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🎭 Emotion-Aware** | Adapts responses based on detected emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) |
| **👶 Age-Appropriate** | Adjusts language complexity for ages 5-16 |
| **🛡️ Safety-First** | Multi-layer content filtering and moderation |
| **🔒 Privacy** | All data stored locally, no cloud dependencies |
| **🧠 Memory System** | Ethical, consent-based conversation context |
| **⚡ Optimized** | Runs efficiently on Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB/8GB) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites**: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB recommended) or PC with GPU for training.

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/NotShubham1112/ai-mirror.git
cd ai-mirror

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_training.txt
```

### 2. Run the System
To start the full AI Mirror system on your machine or Raspberry Pi:

```bash
python src/run_ai_mirror.py
```

For detailed setup, see [**HOW_TO_RUN.md**](docs/HOW_TO_RUN.md).

## 🛡️ Safety & Ethics

This project prioritizes **Safety by Design**:
1.  **Filter**: Blocks inappropriate content *before* it reaches the LLM.
2.  **Validate**: Checks the LLM's output before showing it to the user.
3.  **Privacy**: No data leaves the device.
